        <h4>ACT I
            SCENE I
            Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante
            </h4>
            Mme. Pernelle.  Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.
Elmire.  I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.</br>
Mme. Pernelle.  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.</br>
        I don't wish to cause you any bother.
Elmire.  What duty demands, I insist on giving.
        But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</br>
Mme. Pernelle.  I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
        And no one cares what I wish to have done.
        Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
        For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
        And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
        And truly this is a home for the king of louts!</br>
Dorine.  If . . .</br>
Mme. Pernelle.   You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
        A little brazen and very sassy,
        You butt into everything to speak your mind
