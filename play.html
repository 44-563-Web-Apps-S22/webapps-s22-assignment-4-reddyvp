        <h4>ACT I
            SCENE I
            Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante
            </h4>
            Mme. Pernelle.  Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.
<h6>Elmire</h6>. <p> I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.</p></br>
<h6>Mme</h6>.<p> Pernelle.  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.</br>
        I don't wish to cause you any bother.</p>
<h6>Elmire</h6>. <p> What duty demands, I insist on giving.
        But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</p></br>
<h6>Mme</h6>.<p> Pernelle.  I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .</br>
        And no one cares what I wish to have done.</br>
        Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied</br>
        For all my wise advice has been defied . . .</br>
        And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,</br>
        And truly this is a home for the king of louts!</p></br>
<h6>Dorine</h6>.<p>  If . . .</p></br>
<h6>Mme</h6>.<p> Pernelle.   You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,</br>
        A little brazen and very sassy,</br>
        You butt into everything to speak your mind</p>
